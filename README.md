<h3>Product Specification</h3>
<p>    The driver and analyze unit for oxygen sensors   offered by SENSORE is to operate the sensor according to the   specification and to convert the sensor signal to a linear output   voltage. The oxygen sensor can be mounted in a chamber connected to the   electronic board by a cable.<br />
</p>
<p>     The driver and analyze board can be used for any type of oxygen   sensor offered by SENSORE because of its general structure. Customized   types of electronic boards are also available.</p>
<h3> Feature: </h3>
<p> · Power consumption about 2.5 – 3.0 Watts<br />
  · Cable length to the sensor up to 10 meters<br />
